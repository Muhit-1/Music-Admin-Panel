# Music Admin Panel (Android App)

This is the **Admin Upload Panel** for the [Music Player App](https://github.com/Muhit-1/Music-Player-App).

This panel allows the admin to upload new songs to the Firebase Firestore database used by the main music player app. Songs are added to both the `songs` collection and the selected `genre` document.
