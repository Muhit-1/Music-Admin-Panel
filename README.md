# Music Admin Panel (Android App)

This is the **Admin Upload Panel** for the [Music Player App](https://github.com/Muhit-1/Music-Player-App).

This panel allows the admin to upload new songs to the Firebase Firestore database used by the main music player app. Songs are added to both the `songs` collection and the selected `genre` document.

## Features

- Upload new song metadata to Firebase:
  - Song ID
  - Title
  - Artist
  - Cover Image URL
  - Audio URL (from [JukeHost](https://jukehost.co.uk))
  - Genre selection (e.g., Pop, Rock, HipHop)
- Automatically updates:
  - `songs` collection with full song details
  - `genre/{genre_name}` document with song ID reference
- Lightweight, single-page admin UI
